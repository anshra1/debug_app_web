TASK: Read Project Component Registry

Before we proceed with any tasks, please:

1. Read the project's component registry at b-global-doc/context-docs/component_registry.md
   This file contains:
   - Available services, managers, widgets, and utilities
   - Their locations, descriptions, and dependencies
   - Project patterns and conventions
   - Directory structure

2. Use this information to:
   - Understand available components you can use
   - Follow project patterns and conventions
   - Locate relevant components
   - Understand component relationships
   - Know where to add new components

Example usage:
"Before we start, please read b-global-doc/context-docs/component_registry.md to understand what components are available in the project and where they are located."

This will help you:
1. Make informed suggestions using existing components
2. Follow project conventions
3. Maintain consistent project structure
4. Avoid recreating existing functionality
5. Understand component dependencies

Please confirm once you've read the registry so we can proceed with the task.
