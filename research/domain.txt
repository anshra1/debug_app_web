Visual Insights & Analytics
Build a dashboard to visualize:
Error trends (frequency over time).
Common categories of errors.
Most recurring errors and their solutions.
Developer activity (e.g., resolved vs. unresolved errors).
Tools to use:
Flutter web or a dashboard library (e.g., Syncfusion or Chart.js).
For server-side, integrate with Firebase Analytics or a visualization
 tool like Supabase's built-in UI.


Error Documentation System
Automatically generate documentation for each error:
Include the error message, priority, tags, possible causes, and
 solutions.
Format it as Markdown or HTML.
Store in Superbase or integrate with your Notion or knowledge system.

16. Implement NLP for Root Cause Analysis
Add a root cause analysis layer:
Use NLP models to extract the most likely cause from stack traces or logs.
Highlight the key part of the stack trace or code where the error originated.


int ItWorkedOrNot
List listOfUrlsOfSolutions

-- Give solution according to latest version flutter sorting
-- Build a Search System
When a new error occurs:

Encode it using the model.
Compare its embedding with your stored embeddings in Superbase.
Retrieve the most similar errors and their solutions.

3. What are Embeddings?

4. Use cosine similarity to measure how close two error embeddings 
are:

5. Rules based System

6. compare one error to existing error
7. rule-based system combined with similarity matching

8. . Adjust Similarity Threshold Dynamically
Instead of using a fixed similarity threshold (e.g., 80%), make it dynamic based on
