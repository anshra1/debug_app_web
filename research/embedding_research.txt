so when we upload multiple things about error from bebug and stackTrace
we just convert all the things into text or anything where searching is easy or only to search 
embedding text or similarly
in short converting long things to short and concise where search become easy



This system:

Converts complex errors into searchable signatures by:

Extracting the error type
Finding the relevant code location
Identifying key words from the error message
Creating a unique signature


Makes searching efficient by:

First trying exact signature matches
Falling back to type + keyword matches
Using database indexes for fast lookups


Preserves the full error information while making it searchable

The benefits are:

Quick error matching
Reduced storage needs
Easy to find similar errors
Maintainable error database
Efficient searching

Embeddings are dense vector representations of text that capture 
semantic meaning. Errors with similar meanings will have vectors 
that are close in the vector space.

Pretrained Models

Use a pretrained natural language processing (NLP) model 
to convert text into embeddings. Popular options include:
Sentence-BERT (SBERT): Best for semantic similarity tasks. 
Use the sentence-transformers library in Python.
OpenAI's Embeddings (e.g., Ada): Use OpenAI's embedding API 
for high-quality embeddings.
Hugging Face Models: Search for text similarity models.

Key features of this implementation:

//// can we make our own long string of embedding so that when 
some text came they just read embedding text match similarites

Predefined embeddings for common text patterns
Simple but extensible embedding generation for new text
Cosine similarity calculation
Easy to customize and expand the embedding dimensions
No external API dependencies

To customize this for your needs, you can:

Add more predefined embeddings
Modify the embedding generation logic
Adjust the vector dimensions
Change the similarity threshold
Add more sophisticated text analysis
