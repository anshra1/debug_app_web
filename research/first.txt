4. Generate Text Embeddings
Convert your error messages and solutions into embeddings:

5. Compare Similarity
Use cosine similarity to measure how close two error embeddings are:

6. Build a Search System
When a new error occurs:

Encode it using the model.
Compare its embedding with your stored embeddings in Superbase.
Retrieve the most similar errors and their solutions.

7. Deploy the Model
Local Deployment:
Integrate the embedding and similarity logic directly into your Linux app or VS Code extension.
Cloud Deployment:
Use a cloud service (e.g., Firebase Functions, AWS Lambda) to handle embedding and similarity requests.
Store precomputed embeddings in Superbase for faster retrieval.

8. Scale with Faiss for Large Databases
If your error database becomes very large, calculate and index embeddings using Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search):

9. Fine-Tune a Model (Optional)
If you want better performance:

Fine-tune a model like Sentence-BERT on your specific error database.
Use pairs of similar errors as training data (e.g., "NullPointerException" and "TypeError").

10. Continuous Improvement
Store user feedback on suggested solutions to improve recommendations.
Periodically retrain or fine-tune the model as your database grows.
